.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
SWD Context Structure definition. 

It stores all the information about the library, drivers and interface configuration, target status along with DAP/AHBAP data/instruction internal registers, and the command queue. Bus operations are stored on the command queue. There may be more than one context in use by a host software, each one for single interface-target pair. Most of the target operations made with libswd are required to pass \fBswd_ctx_t\fP pointer structure that also remembers last known state of the target's internal registers.
