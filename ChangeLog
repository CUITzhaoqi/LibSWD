LibSWD-0.6-devel:
 * Introducing CLI (Command Line Interface) parser framework. Updated error defines.
 * Major fixes in LOG functions. Introducing vprintf() like libswd_log_internal_va().
 * Added DEFAULT defines for LogLevel and AutoFixErrors libswdctx->config values.

LibSWD-0.5:
 * All functions and defines were renamed to use prefix libswd_ and LIBSWD_.
 * This is a first and official candidate for release with OpenOCD master.

LibSWD-0.4 (2012-10-14):
 * Implemented necessary data phase on ACK={WAIT,FAULT} reply from Target.
 * Unknown ACK response and Protocol Error Sequence detection.
 * swd_cmd_t was added *errors to hold queue for error handling in ACK element.
 * automatic error handling on queue was not included in this release yet.
 * fixed swd_cmdq_free_tail()
 * swd_cmdq_flush() updates swdctx->cmdq upon execution.
 * swd_drv_transmit() updates swdctx->log values only on successful transmit.
 * DP and AP operations including MEM-AP now works.
 * OpenOCD integration is almost done, flashing works (1938B/18.6s with FT2232).

LibSWD-0.3 (2011-11-11):
 * Fixed critical issue with ACK/DATA bitswap due erratic ARM documentation.
 * Fixes and improvements in libswd.h.
 * Debug hint function in Request packet decoposition (libswd_drv).

LibSWD-0.1 (2011-04-02):
Initial release of LibSWD:
 * Basic functionality of transport, queue and drivers for ADIv5.0.
